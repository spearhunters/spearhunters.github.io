I"<p>We are Calvin &amp; Oscar Hawkes from <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Hh4mug5jk4S2">Monterey, CA</a>. Oscar is 3 years younger, but 5 inches taller, so Calvin thinks it’s a wash.</p>

<p>In 2016, Oscar bought his first speargun and the rest is history. Turns out, fishing is much more fun when you are trying to shoot the fish with a sort of modified crossbow. We were no longer stuck on the surface with a pole in our hands, hoping a fish would bite the hook. We could actively hunt fish, holding our breath and tracking them down through any hole or crevice we could find.</p>

<p>As we started to get deeper and more involved in the sport, we realized there was a serious lack of information about the sport online. It seems everytime I had a question, the only results were a 5-year old forum post or some sketchy looking website from the ’90s. So we created SpearHunters. A modern, up-to-date guide to spearfishing. We wrote these guides in hopes that other speros will find the information as useful as we did.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
