teaser: "The Freediving fin is an essential piece of equipment for spearfishing. Sure you can get away with using scuba fins, but this will drastically affect your performance. There are a couple key differences between freediving fins and scuba fins. The first thing you notice is the length. Freediving fins are much longer than normal fins. This allows the diver to take fewer kicks to reach the desired depth, which conserves oxygen and keeps the heart rate down. The second main difference is the foot pocket. Scuba fins have a strap around the heel, whereas with the free diving fin, you must slide your foot into the pocket like a shoe. The closed-heel pocket allows for maximum transfer of energy from foot to fin. Remember, conserving energy is the main way to get longer breath holds. "

</div>
These are simple fins perfect for those who are just getting into the sport. They have a one-piece, plastic, construction. Although plastic is not the best material to make fins out of, they are basically indestructible. This will allow you to get used to using freediving fins without having to worry about breaking any blades and it is easy on the wallet.


## Best for Intermediate

    <li><strong>Energy Transfer:</strong><span> Good</span></li>
  </ul>
</div>
These fins are a few steps up from the Rob Allen fins. Not only do they have carbon blades, but they are fully modular. Fiberglass has much more spring compared to plastic fins, which results in a better transfer of energy into the blade. The great thing about these fins is that you can upgrade or replace the blades later down the line. They make a few blade stiffnesses to suit your diving style.

## Best for Advanced

  </ul>
</div>
Often called the best fins out there, the DiveR carbon fins are a gold standard in this sport. They are praised for having the softest blades on the market, which makes diving feel like meditation. The Carbon fiber is not only more flexible, but also transfers the maximum amount of energy. If you are looking to take your diving to the next level, these are the fins for you.

Mako is a great company for those of us who are trying to save money. Unlike a lot of other budget companies, Mako has amazing customer service. When first getting into the sport, you are going to be spending a descent chunk of money to get all the required gear. Thankfully, with a sub-$100 price tag, these fins are going to help keep that cost down.

For less than $200, it is going to be hard to find a fin with this much to offer. You not only get an indestructible blade, but a modular construction. The Razor foot pockets that come with these are some of the best foot pockets on the market. These will last you forever and also give you a nice platform to upgrade from.

## Best Fins for Small Feet

For those of you that have small or narrow feet, it can be tough to find a good fitting set of fins. Many brands only offer larger sizes, and make foot pockets for normal width feet. Leaderfins not only offer smaller sizes than most, but also make their foot pockets a bit on the tighter side. One other problem that people with smaller feet run into is ankle fatigue, due to the stiffness of the fin blades. With a smaller foot, there is more strain put on the ankle having to propel the same size blade through the water. Leaderfins manufactures their blades on the softer side. The combination of a narrow foot pocket with a super soft blade makes these fins a pleasure to dive with if you have small or narrow feet.
