teaser: "By far the most important piece of equipment while freediving and spearfishing is the wetsuit. While diving you are going to be spending a lot of time in the water and staying warm is a must. There are many types of wetsuits out there, but a freedive/spearfishing specific wetsuit is what you want to have. A surfing wetsuit is designed for use on the surface of the water and will not keep you warm while diving. A scuba suit will work, but it is not ideal for the type of diving you are going to be doing. The materials used to construct a scuba suit restrict flexibility and are much thicker, requiring you to wear more weight. A freedive/spearfishing suit typically comes in two pieces; the pants, and the hooded top. This eliminates the need for a zipper and helps keep water from flushing in. Because you rely on your own oxygen and normally spend longer in the water, comfort and warmth are crucial."

## Construction

While researching the perfect suit to buy, you are going to run into a few new terms; open cell, closed cell, single lined, double lined and naked neoprene. There are a few different ways to construct a freedive/spearfishing specific wetsuit and each has their own strengths and weaknesses.


### Double-lined
Also referred to as “closed cell”. This suit has a lycra or nylon lining on both the inside and outside of the suit. This is how surf and scuba suits are constructed. This makes the suit much more durable and easy to get on. Unfortunately the lining on the outside restricts flexibility and decreases hydrodynamics. The lining on the inside makes it less warm.

      <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong><span>  1</span></li>
      <li><strong>Hydrodynamic:</strong><span> 2</span></li>
    </ul>
  </div>


### Single-Lined (outside)
This is by far the most common freedive suit and the only type of suit used in spearfishing. The outer lining increases durability and prevents tears while bumping into rocks and other objects under water. Not only this, but it protects the neoprene from the harmful sun rays. It is the perfect combination of durability, flexibility and warmth. Because the inside is unlined, or open cell, it keeps you very warm. Untreated neoprene is like foam and has tons of little pores. These pores act like mini suction cups and cling to your skin, preventing any water from entering the suit. This “naked neoprene” on the inside of the suit is very fragile! Not only do you need lubricant to get into the suit, but even your fingernails can gouge holes in it. Be careful and this should not be a big problem.

<mark><strong>TIP:</strong>Open cell typically refers to an untreated inside of the suit.</mark>

    <li><strong>Hydrodynamic:</strong><span> 3</span></li>
  </ul>
</div>


### Single-Lined (inside)
While this is also classified as a closed cell suit, it is completely different than a double lined suit and is usually referred to as “smooth skin”. This is basically the opposite of the other single lined wetsuit, The lycra lining is on the inside and the naked neoprene is on the outside. One difference is that the neoprene on the outside is coated with a material that fills in all the pores to make it more hydrodynamic. The lack of lining on the outside makes these suits ill fit for most kinds of diving. These are freedive specific and are only really worn by those who compete. The exposed neoprene degrades in UV light, so they will not last as long and require lots of care. Although the inner lining decreases the thermal capabilities, it makes the suit much easier to get on and off. No need for a lubricant.

  </ul>

### Full Lycra

This type of suit is the thinnest of the suits. It is made without neoprene and are more like a full-body rash guard. Tropical divers use these to add protection from the sun and the reef. These are a stretchy one piece suit without a zipper.

<mark><strong>TIP:</strong>If you are at all confused, go to your local dive shop and ask what thickness suit people are wearing in your area. </mark>

### Cold Water

<p><i>Usually 5-7mm</i></p>
Get the thinnest suit you can handle to maximize comfort. The thicker the suit, the more your breathing will be restricted. A thin suit also adds buoyancy and requires you to add more weight while diving. This makes it harder on your initial descent. There are two options for wetsuit bottoms; “High-waisted” and “Farmer John’s”. High waisted will allow the most flexibility and comfort, but if you still need more warmth and do not want to go to the next thickness, farmer john bottoms are a great option. These bottoms have straps that go over the shoulders. This doubles the amount of suit that covers your core and does a great job at keeping you warm. They do, however, compress your diaphragm and make it more difficult to inhale.

<mark><strong>TIP:</strong>Wetsuits compress over time. 3mm suit will only stay that thick for so long</mark>

## Color
These are definitely not all of the aspects of a speargun, but with this information you should be able to narrow down your search to a couple great options that are perfectly suited for you. There is nothing worse than getting your first gun and realising that it is not at all suited for what you’re doing.
