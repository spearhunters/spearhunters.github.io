## Diving Environment and Gun Length

The first thing to consider before you start browsing for a weapon is to figure out what type of environment and conditions you will be diving in. From there you can start to narrow down your options. There are three main types of spearfishing; hole hunting, Reef hunting and blue water hunting. They each require different types of spearguns. The most important factor to consider while buying a speargun is the length. Length is mainly determined by the environment you will be diving in and the types of fish you will encounter there. The longer the gun, the more accurate and powerful it will be, but it will be harder to wield.


### Hole Hunting
Chances are, if you are just starting out, that you will be hole hunting. This style typically occurs in shallow waters and you will be shooting your fish from a short distance. The ideal gun for this would be short. This allows maneuverability and since the fish are close, the decreased accuracy is not an issue. Pole spears are able to be used for this type of diving, so some people choose to go this route. Hole hunting is also common in areas with lower visibility. If you are unaware of the kind of hunting that takes place in your area, call your local dive shop or check online posts from your area.

</div>

### Reef Hunting
The second type of spearfishing is reef hunting. Here you will be targeting fish from a further distance. The average depth is deeper and you will be doing less moving around once you are at the bottom. Accuracy is going to be playing much more of a role here, so you are going to want a longer gun. Some people attach a reel to their guns to extend the length of their shooting line, which enables them to hold onto their gun while swimming to the surface after hitting a fish.

</div>

### Blue Water
Lastly, we have blue water hunting. This is where you’re hunting within the water column and not from the bottom. The fish are bigger and the power and accuracy required are pushed to the limit. The specifications for these guns are very particular and dependant on what species you are going for. Things to consider for blue water hunting are gun length,number of bands, spear shaft and tip type.

## Spear Shaft/Tips

Choosing the right shaft and tip is completely dependent on what kind of fish you are going after. A thinner shaft will travel through the water faster, but because it has less mass, there is less penetrating power. Shaft diameters range from 6-9mm. Thinner shafts are best suited for smaller fish. The sharp part of the shaft is called the tip. This is either threaded on, or built in. There are four main types of spear tips: breakaway, single flopper, double flopper and paralyzer tip.

### Breakaway
<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/breakaway-tip-speargun.jpg" />
</div>
A breakaway tip separates from the shaft after penetrating the fish. This is used for larger fish and allows you to separate yourself and speargun from the fish after your shot. The tip and fish are left connected to a different line which allows you and your gun to return to the surface safely.

### Flopper
<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/flopper-tip-speargun.jpg" />
</div>
The flopper is a metal piece that helps keep the fish on the shaft after being speared. A single flopper is most common and can be used for small to medium sized fish. For larger fish, a second flopper may be required.

### Paralyzer
<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/paralyzer-tip-speargun.jpg" />
</div>
Last, we have the paralyzer tip. Instead of a single point, there is a cluster of smaller, barbed tips. There is no flopper, and should only be used for small fish. The advantage of these is that less penetration is required to get a good hold on the fish. A spear tip must pass all the way through a fish before it is properly secured.


## Reel
<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/speargun-reels-pro-series-predator.jpg" />
</div>

A reel is a detachable piece, similar to the reel on a fishing pole, that allows you to let out more line and reel the fish back in once you reach the surface. Some fish tend to take off once they are hit and may rip the gun out of your hand or drag you down while you are going up for a breath. These are not used in shallower waters or with smaller fish because it over complicates things. The addition of all the extra line can be a safety hazard, so double check what kind of fish you are targeting before adding a reel.

## Speargun Material
<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/speargun-material.png" />
</div>

There are 3 common materials used to make the body of the speargun: wood, aluminum and carbon fiber. The most widely used material is aluminum tubing. Aluminum is cheap, light and simple. In addition, they can really take a beating and require very little maintenance apart from a fresh water rinse. The major downside to metal is that it transmits sound very well underwater. The sound may scare away potential prey. Wood is also a common construction material. It is the strongest material and dampens sound well. Depending on the wood used, the price of these guns can be astronomical, although they do make wood guns in all price ranges. The third common material used is carbon fiber. The main advantages of carbon fiber is it’s rigid and light. The rigidity allows a more powerful and accurate shot. Because they are light, they are easy to travel with. Just like wooden guns, carbon fiber guns can be shaped into hydrodynamic shapes that help with maneuverability with larger guns.

## Open/Closed Mussel
<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/open-closed-muzzle.png" />
</div>

The muzzle refers to the tip of the gun.  A closed muzzle has a small hole that the shaft must pass through.  This loosely secures the shaft and some people find it to be easier to load than the open muzzle.  The open muzzle lacks this hole at the tip of the gun, so you must secure the shaft to the gun using the overshaft wrapping technique.  This secures the shaft tightly to the gun with the shooting line and provides better accuracy.  I actually find reloading with an open muzzle much faster, so I recommend going with this style.

## Bands
<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/bands.jpg" />
</div>

There are a few key aspects to speargun bands. The number of bands used, the length and the thickness. Specific band materials also play a role, but that is more about personal preference than anything else. Most spearguns use between one and three bands. Number of bands and their thickness will determine the power of your particular gun. For small to medium fish you will be using one or two bands. You can use one thicker band or two thinner bands to achieve the same power. The benefits of a single band is the simplicity and speed of reloading. Using two bands required less strength to reload each individual band and allows you to vary the power output. If you have a close shot with a rock behind the fish, you may only want to use one of the two bands to prevent the shaft from bending from the impact against the rock. The same goes for two versus three bands. The only difference being an increase in potential power.


## Other Types of Spearguns

### Pole Spear
<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/Spearfishing-Traveler-Pole-Spear-1.jpg" />
</div>

These are a great, cheap alternative to a speargun. They do not work for every kind of hunting, but they are a perfect option for some people. They are used for close range targets and can even take out some medium sized fish. They can be a bit harder to use, but the ability to quickly reload and take multiple shots with a single breath can be a huge advantage!

### Pneumatic
<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/pneumatic-cressi.jpg" />
</div>

These spearguns used compressed air, instead of bands, to propel the spear. The elimination of the bands results in a compact, sleek design. The downside to these guns is the need to pump up the chamber between each shot. They are perfect for shallow water diving, but loose power the deeper you go, due to the air compressing within the chamber.

### Roller Guns
<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/Neptonics-Double-Roller-Front.jpg" />
</div>

These are band powered spearguns, but are attached in a different way. They are typically all blue water guns. The advantage with these is the ability to pack more power into a shorter gun. The roller eliminates slack band length on top of the gun and allows the band to be stretched further within a smaller package.

## Be Safe
These are definitely not all of the aspects of a speargun, but with this information you should be able to narrow down your search to a couple great options that are perfectly suited for you. There is nothing worse than getting your first gun and realising that it is not at all suited for what you’re doing.
