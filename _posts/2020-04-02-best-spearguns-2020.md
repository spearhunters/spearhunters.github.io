teaser: "The wetsuit is a divers best friend. It allows you to spend prolonged periods of time out in the water comfortably. Wetsuits come in a few different thicknesses and you want to make sure you get the proper one for the water temperatures in your area. This article will focus on spearfishing wetsuits rather than the many other types of suits out there. Spearfishing suits give a perfect combination of flexibility and durability and allow you to get the most out of a hunt. They are a 2-piece suit and sometimes, the jacket and pants are sold separately, so keep that in mind. Also, the thicker the suit you need, the more expensive it will be."

This is a very nice suit to start out with. It is made from a very stretchy neoprene which will make you feel super comfortable in the water. As a beginner, the last thing you need is to feel constricted while diving.

## Best for Intermediate

This is a top of the line, off-the-shelf, wetsuit. It is manufactured under the highest standards for its class. It is warm, durable and worn by many of the professionals.

## Best Value for Money

It is hard to go wrong with this suit. It is sold directly by the manufacture, so you will not be paying any distribution costs. It is made from the gold-standard Yamamoto neoprene and includes a built in knife pocket. It is a great all-around suit at a great price point.

This is hardly a spearfishing wetsuit, but for such a low cost it will still be included in this article. It is a hooded, two-piece wetsuit, with farmer john bottoms. It will keep you much warmer than a surfing wetsuit and is practically indestructible. It comes in only one thickness and is not open-cell, but it is cheap as hell and a good way to get started in the sport.
