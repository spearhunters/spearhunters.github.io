## Mask / Snorkel ($20)

<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/omer-alien-mask.jpg" />
</div>

Let’s start with the mask first. It is far more important to find the correct mask compared to the snorkel because there is no one-size fits all option. Everyone has unique facial geometry, making it essential to actually go in and try on multiple different masks. Since this is a beginners guide, we will just be looking at the fit. Okay, so you might be wondering how one goes about ensuring a perfect fit? Well the two factors we are testing are the <strong>seal</strong> and <strong>comfort</strong> of the mask.


<mark><strong>PRO TIP:</strong>You should shave any facial hair that will be in between the mask and your skin.</mark>

First thing to do when fitting is to remove the straps of the mask. You can get any mask to seal to your face if you cinch the straps tight enough, but the headache that will ensue is NOT worth it. Place the front of the mask to your face and gently press it on while inhaling through your nose to create a light suction. Tilt your head around and contort your face. A proper fitting mask will stay on for this test.
Next thing to look out for is the comfort. If any part of the mask seems to be hitting you in a weird place or digging in, keep looking. The chaffing that can result from this is no fun at all. One thing to note is that the more flexible the silicon skirt is, the better the seal you are going to get.

<strong>Note:</strong> Some new masks will chafe the face for the first few dives. This will not be immediately evident while trying on masks in the store. This is due to the edges of the silicon and they will wear down. Scrubbing the edges with a coarse sponge can expedite this process.

Since we are trying to get spearing on a budget, there is no need to get a freedive specific mask. Any mask that seals properly and is comfortable for you is great for now. An added bonus of getting a cheap mask is that they almost always come with a snorkel. We won’t be too picky when it comes to snorkels since they are not very expensive. If given a choice, go with the most simple [J-Style] snorkel. This is simply because the snorkels that come with an inexpensive mask are cheaply made and the added bits will just break. Let’s save ourselves the headache and go with the simple one.

These cheap masks are going to be what we call high-volume masks. This simply means that there is a larger volume of air between your face and the mask. Freediving specific masks are referred to as low-volume masks, and are much more expensive. The reason spearos prefer the low-volume masks is due to the fact that as you dive deeper, the mask compresses. Without equalizing the mask, you run the risk of getting “mask squeeze”.  This can result in broken blood vessels and a set of nice black eyes. Imagine a massive hickey across your face.  Not pretty! To equalize, you must exhale some air through your nose into the mask to combat the external pressure as you go deeper. Low-volume masks require less of your precious oxygen to equalize the mask. Thankfully this only really comes into play at depths below 30 or 40 feet.  For shallow diving there will be little to no benefit.

<p class="font-size-h3">Where to Buy</p>

I recommend going to a sporting goods store over a dive shop for this because they will have much cheaper options. Remember, if you find multiple masks that fit, go for the cheapest one. Walmart and Target are also great places to check.

<p class="font-size-h3"> Pretreating a New Mask</p>

Okay, so you finally bought your mask and you are ready to get into the water to try it out. There is one last step that even hardened vets forget to do before going out. You must clean the lenses before the first use, otherwise it is going to fog up so bad that you won’t be able to see anything. Dive session ruined! The lenses come out of the box with silicone residue/film that we must remove prior to the first use. There are a few remedies out there, but the easiest method is using toothpaste. The grit is enough to scrub the silicon, but not enough to scratch the lenses. This might take a few times to get it completely clean. Now your mask is ready.

## Weights + Belt ($30)

<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/weights_for_diving-600x450.jpg" />
</div>

Weights are a necessary part of spearfishing. They allow you to reach the bottom with ease. The amount of weights you will use is dependent on how deep you plan on going and how buoyant you are with you suit on. Starting out, the key is to weight your belt so you become neutrally buoyant at about 15 feet down. This allows you to float at the surface, but still be able to sink to the bottom after a few kicks. For spearfishing, a rubber belt with a quick release clasp is ideal. As you descend on your dive, the pressure will compress you, making the belt become loose. Because a rubber belt stretches, you can cinch it tighter, and as you compress it stays tight to your waist. The quick release is a safety precaution. If you are in trouble the first thing you do is take your weights off. In a time of panic, having to deal with a clasp is not a good idea.

<mark><strong>PRO TIP:</strong>You can use <a href="https://www.divebuddy.com/calculator/weight.aspx" target="_blank">this calculator</a> to determine the amount of weight you will need.</mark>

<p class="font-size-h3">Where to Buy</p>

Any sort of lead block weight will do. Before purchasing this new, check out used weights. If you are lucky you can find them for free on Craigslist or super cheap at a flea market. Lead is surprisingly expensive at the store.

## Fins ($50)

<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/mako-freediving-fins-2.jpg" />
</div>

Here we have one of the key pieces of your setup. Fins are a necessity and there are so many different options, it can be overwhelming. To start out I will describe a few different types of fins. First we compare open-heal and full-foot fins. Open-heal fins are used by scuba divers and allows them to fit their large dive boots into the fin. Once your foot is secured, the strap secures the fin to your foot . Next there is full-foot fins. These are the kind you want. Having the foot pocket be one piece allows for maximum transfer of energy into the fin blade. Their low profile also creates less drag. In spearfishing you want your movements to be as efficient as possible to conserve your air. Now that we have narrowed our choices down a bit, we can talk about what options are best for you.

Swim fins are going to be the cheaper option but they are not designed for what you will be using them for. They are much shorter than a freediving fins, forcing you to take more kicks to reach the bottom. This will deplete your oxygen reserves substantially.
When I was going through the grueling task of acquiring my spearfishing starter pack, I came across an ongoing debate as to which fins are best to buy as a newbie. Some people say just go with the cheaper option since, as a beginner, there is no guarantee that you will end up pursuing this sport into the future. It would be a waste of money to get the high end if you don't even know if you will even end up liking the sport. The other side argues that when it comes to fins, the price jump to freediving fins is well worth it. In Addition, your fins are likely to be the first thing you upgrade as you progress in the sport. Swim fins will do for your first few dives if you are strapped for cash and need to borrow some but I do not recommend investing any money into non-freediving fins.

Let’s talk about freediving fins. These are going to look huge compared to any other type of fins. They too are going to be full-footed. The length allows you to get to the bottom with a fraction of the effort. Material of the blades come into play here as well. The stiffer and springier the blade, the more energy will be transferred into the blades. You are going to want to go with a polymer blade. Although they are less efficient than fiberglass or carbon fiber fins, they are a hell of a lot more durable. I have seen so many people splurge on some nice fiberglass fins only to find themselves with a useless snapped fin ten minutes into the hunt. These fins are going to cost you around $70 for an intro grade pair and should last you a long time.

<p class="font-size-h3">Where to Buy</p>

There are many websites to purchase freediving fins from. Here are a few that have a wide selection:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.leisurepro.com/" target="_blank">leisurepro.com</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.freedivershop.com/" target="_blank">freedivershop.com</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">amazon.com</a></li>
</ul>

<strong>Note:</strong> Your local dive shop will be your best friend. It may be more expensive but, if you can afford it, it is well worth going there. They typically have great return policies and a variety of sizes to try on. It also supports your local diving community.

## Dive Knife ($10)

<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/k6_knife-sm.jpg" />
</div>

This is a necessity for both safety and killing your fish. You want to make sure the knife you get is sufficient. A folding knife will not do. You want to get a fixed blade knife with a sheath that you can strap to your body. Because the blade is going to have to puncture the skull of the fist, a nice narrow point is ideal. Serration is also a nice feature to look for. While you are puncturing the brain of the fish, realized that your hand is just on the other side of the fish. A long knife may go clean through into your hand. You should view your dive knife as semi-disposable since they are lost so often.

<mark><strong>PRO TIP:</strong> It is often useful to have an extra knife. You may lose one in the middle of a hunt, or not be able to reach one with your available hand.  They are cheap, so there is no harm in being over prepared.
</mark>

<p class="font-size-h3">Where to Buy</p>
There are plenty of dive knives online for around $10. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a> is probably the easiest.

## Stringer ($20)

<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/stringer-SSLFS-2.jpg" />
</div>

This simple device is often overlooked. It’s only once you forget it that you realize how important it is. The stringer. You have to have some place to put your kill. There are a few different styles of stringer, but any type will do at this point, just make sure it is secure. You don’t want to have any of your catch to go missing. The stringer is going to either be attached to your weight belt, or some sort of flotation device. Just know that if you plan on hanging it off your belt, it can hinder your mobility or get caught in the kelp.

<p class="font-size-h3">Where to Buy</p>
You can get a cheap stringer at any fishing supply store, order one online or simply make your own. I have seen one made from a coat hanger. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon</a> is always a cheap option.

## Wetsuit ($200)

<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/salvimar-nat-suit.jpg" />
</div>

Being cold sucks. Wearing proper gear for your environment is key. A suit is more often than not a must when it comes to spearfishing. A suit is also where you are going to be spending a large portion of your budget. For your first few dives I would recommend using any wetsuit you can get your hands on. If you are diving in colder waters, getting a hooded vest to go over the top is a must. If you decide you like the sport, you are going to want to buy a spearfishing specific wetsuit. For your first proper wetsuit you are going to be spending some money, but the lack of zippers, built in hood and open-cell neoprene is going to make it infinitely more comfortable and warm. Watch out though, they are much more delicate and require a certain level of care to maintain them. Two great companies that offer budget spearfishing wetsuits are Mako Spearguns and Salvimar. The prices depend on how thick of a suit you need, but it is going to cost you around $200-$350. Once you know what thickness you need, the next step is to find out what size you are. Sizing charts online are typically pretty accurate, but you are going to want to measure yourself. The sizes for different brands are often different.

## Gloves ($10)

<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/dive-gloves-walmart.jpeg" />
</div>

This may seem of minimal importance, especially if you are going to be diving in warmer waters but gloves are crucial. They provide much needed protection from the environment and warmth for those colder waters . You would be surprised how many sharp things are down there. Ironically, most spearfishing gloves provide less protection than you might require. This is good for us though. Remember we are thrifty people and spearfishing specific equipment is typically exceedingly pricey.

<p class="font-size-h3">Where to Buy</p>
If you don’t have a problem with cold hands, go to your local hardware store and buy a pair of Nitrile or Latex coated work gloves. These gloves are going to offer way more
protection and I picked up my current pair for less than $5. They also last a lot longer than the fancy neoprene gloves I previously used.

## Socks ($15)

<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/dive-socks.jpg" />
</div>

Socks serve two functions; warmth and comfort. They prevent your foot from chaffing and help get a nice snug fit in your fins. When shore diving, they make your walk to the water so much more enjoyable, especially when it’s a rocky environment. If you are shore diving, these socks are going to be semi-disposable since the pavement and rocks really tear at the neoprene. Due to this, the cheapest option is going to be the best option.

<p class="font-size-h3">Where to Buy</p>
As you might have guessed, I have a hot tip to save money on this piece of your setup. Aliexpress! Have you heard of it? It is a Chinese Amazon type marketplace, but with vastly reduced prices... and quality. Since we are only talking about socks here, there isn’t going to be a huge difference between the $30 brand name socks and the cheap Chinese knockoffs.

<strong>Warning:</strong> They often have misleading pictures and descriptions of their products. It is not a good idea to buy anything expensive from this site. You WILL have a bad day when your shipment arrives. <

<mark><strong>PRO TIP:</strong> Make sure you are buying dive socks not dive boots. Dive boots have a thick sole like a shoe and you will not be able to fit them into the type of fins you will be wearing.
</mark>

## Weapon ($150)

<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/speargun.jpg" />
</div>

Lastly, we need something to hunt with. There are some different options for this. There are two general categories: the pole spear and the speargun. A pole spear is far less expensive than a speargun gun, so lots of beginners start there and then move up to a gun. The problem with this idea is that a pole is much harder to hunt with. A beginning spearo has so much more to deal with than
simply getting a proper shot off. I think it is a good idea to start with a speargun since it will get you familiar with the sport faster. When buying a speargun, what you need to know first is the types of fish and kind of environment you are going to be diving in. Because you won't be able to go very deep at first, there is no need for a long gun. Short guns are much easier to wield underwater and allow you to place more focus on the hunt. Ask your local dive shop or look in forums to see what size and type of guns people are using in your area. There are a lot of different styles of guns with a lot of conflicting opinions about each type.  To make this easy on you, I will briefly describe the different types of guns out there.

<strong>Band Powered:</strong> This is a speargun that propels the spear using a rubber band, similar to a slingshot on a stick.  These are the most common style of gun and are easy to maintain and repair.  Either one or two bands are normally used, depending on how much power you desire.  Two lighter bands are useful if you want the power, but do not have the strength to load a single powerful band.  A single band is more desirable for beginners because it is simple and less likely to get tangled up.  Most band powered guns come with the option of either open or closed muzzle.  The muzzle refers to the tip of the gun.  A closed muzzle has a small hole that the shaft must pass through.  This loosely secures the shaft and some people find it to be easier to load than the open muzzle.  The open muzzle lacks this hole at the tip of the gun, so you must secure the shaft to the gun using the overshaft wrapping technique.  This secures the shaft tightly to the gun with the shooting line and provides better accuracy.  I actually find reloading with an open muzzle much faster, so I recommend going with this style.  There are a lot of different terms people throw around describing different types of guns such as railgun, pipe gun, Euro gun, American style, ect.  For now, this is not so important.

For a cheap reliable gun, it is hard to beat the Mako Predator. It is simple and stands the test of time. I recommend getting the single banded option because it is just less to deal with. Regardless of what gun you pick, an open-mussel is going to make your life a lot easier while reloading.

<p class="font-size-h3">Where to Buy</p>

There are many websites to buy spearguns from. Here are a few that have a wide selection:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.makospearguns.com/" target="_blank">makospearguns.com</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.leisurepro.com/" target="_blank">leisurepro.com</a></li>

  <li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/" target="_blank">amazon.com</a></li>
</ul>

## Float / Flag ($30)

<div class="text-center">
  <img class="product" src="{{site.url}}/{{site.urlimg}}/float-flags-l400.jpg" />
</div>

Some sort of flotation device is not necessary, but can prove useful. They are great for holding your stringer, a water bottle, and a dive flag. Lots of people simply make one out of an old boogie board. Having a float out with you is nice if your leg cramps up, or if a strong current arises. You should be able to buy a float and flag from any local dive shop, or the websites mentioned above in other sections.

<strong>Note:</strong> Make sure to check local regulations. Some regions require a dive flag while you are in the water.

## Take Care of Your Gear

Once you have all your gear you are going to need to learn how to care for it all. If neglected, the equipment will deteriorate very quickly! The combination of saltwater and sun is a killer. When maintained properly, this stuff should last you a good while. Upgrading your equipment is inevitable and will be a process of its own.
