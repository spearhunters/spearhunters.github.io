      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laminated teak&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Riffe Euro is the gold standard of spearguns and for good reason! With its laminated teak construction, it is durable and neutrally buoyant. It is a simple gun, but it is perfect. It is powerful and accurate while still being silent. With a company like Riffe it is hard to go wrong and this is their flagship model.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downside: Easy to Jam&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you are looking for a budget gun, look no further. The Mako Predator is going to be your best friend. It shoots straight and is built like a tank, so it is pretty hard to go wrong with this gun. Although you will not be able to find these guns in stores, their customer service is one of the best in the game. Because they have no middleman, they are allowed to offer their gear at reduced prices. It is definitely an entry level gun, but this will stay in your arsenal for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downside: More Recoil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Rob Allen is a household name in the spearfishing scene. It has earned its notoriety by consistently making quality products with the spearo in mind. The Tuna line of rail guns is you next step up from entry-level aluminum guns. They manufacture their barrels out of Vecta aluminum, which is a very rigid alloy. This stiffness results in maximum transfer of energy to the shaft and allows for pin-point long-range shots. It comes with a shaft that stands up to maximum abuse and the flopper is extremely reliable. There is nothing worse than tagging a fish, only to realize the flopper did not open and the fish got away. The handle design is often a talking point of this gun. It offers one of the most comfortable grips.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;best-intermediate-gun&quot;&gt;Best Intermediate Gun&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;product-rating-wrapper&quot;&gt;

      &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;gearname text-center&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;ul class=&quot;gear-ratings&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; $288-$415&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solid Wood Design&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reliable trigger mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ergonomic handle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Module spear tip system&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Downside: Very heavy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This gun is an absolute beauty! It is some of the highest quality you will find in a beginner gun. It is made out of solid African Mahogany, which makes it virtually indestructible. It comes in a wide variety of sizes, so you can get a hole hunter or a blue water gun with the same design. I would say the greatest part of this gun is its M8 trigger mechanism. It is very reliable and tough. This, combine with a super comfortable handle makes this gun an amazing option for this price point.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;ul class=&quot;gear-ratings&quot;&gt;

    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;41cm Length&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solid Construction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Great for hole hunting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The Mares Sten is a nifty little gun. It is the shortest available gun on the market making the ultimate hole hunting gun. You can even use this as a second gun strapped to your belt. It is a very solid pneumatic speargun and you can get one for a pretty low price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;gearname text-center&quot;&gt;$180&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a very nice suit to start out with. It is made from a very stretchy neoprene which will make you feel super comfortable in the water. As a beginner, the last thing you need is to feel constricted while diving.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;best-for-intermediate&quot;&gt;Best for Intermediate&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;gearname text-center&quot;&gt;$380&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a top of the line, off-the-shelf, wetsuit. It is manufactured under the highest standards for its class. It is warm, durable and worn by many of the professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;best-value-for-money&quot;&gt;Best Value for Money&lt;/h2&gt;

  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;gearname text-center&quot;&gt;$230&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is hard to go wrong with this suit. It is sold directly by the manufacture, so you will not be paying any distribution costs. It is made from the gold-standard Yamamoto neoprene and includes a built in knife pocket. It is a great all-around suit at a great price point.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;cheapest&quot;&gt;Cheapest&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;box text-center&quot;&gt;

  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
  &lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;gearname text-center&quot;&gt;$60&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is hardly a spearfishing wetsuit, but for such a low cost it will still be included in this article. It is a hooded, two-piece wetsuit, with farmer john bottoms. It will keep you much warmer than a surfing wetsuit and is practically indestructible. It comes in only one thickness and is not open-cell, but it is cheap as hell and a good way to get started in the sport.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are simple fins perfect for those who are just getting into the sport. They have a one-piece, plastic, construction. Although plastic is not the best material to make fins out of, they are basically indestructible. This will allow you to get used to using freediving fins without having to worry about breaking any blades and it is easy on the wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These fins are a few steps up from the Rob Allen fins. Not only do they have carbon blades, but they are fully modular. Fiberglass has much more spring compared to plastic fins, which results in a better transfer of energy into the blade. The great thing about these fins is that you can upgrade or replace the blades later down the line. They make a few blade stiffnesses to suit your diving style.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Often called the best fins out there, the DiveR carbon fins are a gold standard in this sport. They are praised for having the softest blades on the market, which makes diving feel like meditation. The Carbon fiber is not only more flexible, but also transfers the maximum amount of energy. If you are looking to take your diving to the next level, these are the fins for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Mako is a great company for those of us who are trying to save money. Unlike a lot of other budget companies, Mako has amazing customer service. When first getting into the sport, you are going to be spending a descent chunk of money to get all the required gear. Thankfully, with a sub-$100 price tag, these fins are going to help keep that cost down.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;For those of you that have small or narrow feet, it can be tough to find a good fitting set of fins. Many brands only offer larger sizes, and make foot pockets for normal width feet. Leaderfins not only offer smaller sizes than most, but also make their foot pockets a bit on the tighter side. One other problem that people with smaller feet run into is ankle fatigue, due to the stiffness of the fin blades. With a smaller foot, there is more strain put on the ankle having to propel the same size blade through the water. Leaderfins manufactures their blades on the softer side. The combination of a narrow foot pocket with a super soft blade makes these fins a pleasure to dive with if you have small or narrow feet.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;diving-environment-and-gun-length&quot;&gt;Diving Environment and Gun Length&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The first thing to consider before you start browsing for a weapon is to figure out what type of environment and conditions you will be diving in. From there you can start to narrow down your options. There are three main types of spearfishing; hole hunting, Reef hunting and blue water hunting. They each require different types of spearguns. The most important factor to consider while buying a speargun is the length. Length is mainly determined by the environment you will be diving in and the types of fish you will encounter there. The longer the gun, the more accurate and powerful it will be, but it will be harder to wield.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;hole-hunting&quot;&gt;Hole Hunting&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Chances are, if you are just starting out, that you will be hole hunting. This style typically occurs in shallow waters and you will be shooting your fish from a short distance. The ideal gun for this would be short. This allows maneuverability and since the fish are close, the decreased accuracy is not an issue. Pole spears are able to be used for this type of diving, so some people choose to go this route. Hole hunting is also common in areas with lower visibility. If you are unaware of the kind of hunting that takes place in your area, call your local dive shop or check online posts from your area.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;iframe-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/m39Rhokx3_s&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;reef-hunting&quot;&gt;Reef Hunting&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The second type of spearfishing is reef hunting. Here you will be targeting fish from a further distance. The average depth is deeper and you will be doing less moving around once you are at the bottom. Accuracy is going to be playing much more of a role here, so you are going to want a longer gun. Some people attach a reel to their guns to extend the length of their shooting line, which enables them to hold onto their gun while swimming to the surface after hitting a fish.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;iframe-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/QpGMnT6sOD8?start=122&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;blue-water&quot;&gt;Blue Water&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, we have blue water hunting. This is where you’re hunting within the water column and not from the bottom. The fish are bigger and the power and accuracy required are pushed to the limit. The specifications for these guns are very particular and dependant on what species you are going for. Things to consider for blue water hunting are gun length,number of bands, spear shaft and tip type.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;iframe-container&quot;&gt;
  &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/FyLw7Dv2aIc?start=122&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;spear-shafttips&quot;&gt;Spear Shaft/Tips&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Choosing the right shaft and tip is completely dependent on what kind of fish you are going after. A thinner shaft will travel through the water faster, but because it has less mass, there is less penetrating power. Shaft diameters range from 6-9mm. Thinner shafts are best suited for smaller fish. The sharp part of the shaft is called the tip. This is either threaded on, or built in. There are four main types of spear tips: breakaway, single flopper, double flopper and paralyzer tip.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;breakaway&quot;&gt;Breakaway&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/breakaway-tip-speargun.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A breakaway tip separates from the shaft after penetrating the fish. This is used for larger fish and allows you to separate yourself and speargun from the fish after your shot. The tip and fish are left connected to a different line which allows you and your gun to return to the surface safely.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;flopper&quot;&gt;Flopper&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/flopper-tip-speargun.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The flopper is a metal piece that helps keep the fish on the shaft after being speared. A single flopper is most common and can be used for small to medium sized fish. For larger fish, a second flopper may be required.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;paralyzer&quot;&gt;Paralyzer&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/paralyzer-tip-speargun.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Last, we have the paralyzer tip. Instead of a single point, there is a cluster of smaller, barbed tips. There is no flopper, and should only be used for small fish. The advantage of these is that less penetration is required to get a good hold on the fish. A spear tip must pass all the way through a fish before it is properly secured.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;reel&quot;&gt;Reel&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/speargun-reels-pro-series-predator.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;A reel is a detachable piece, similar to the reel on a fishing pole, that allows you to let out more line and reel the fish back in once you reach the surface. Some fish tend to take off once they are hit and may rip the gun out of your hand or drag you down while you are going up for a breath. These are not used in shallower waters or with smaller fish because it over complicates things. The addition of all the extra line can be a safety hazard, so double check what kind of fish you are targeting before adding a reel.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;speargun-material&quot;&gt;Speargun Material&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/speargun-material.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are 3 common materials used to make the body of the speargun: wood, aluminum and carbon fiber. The most widely used material is aluminum tubing. Aluminum is cheap, light and simple. In addition, they can really take a beating and require very little maintenance apart from a fresh water rinse. The major downside to metal is that it transmits sound very well underwater. The sound may scare away potential prey. Wood is also a common construction material. It is the strongest material and dampens sound well. Depending on the wood used, the price of these guns can be astronomical, although they do make wood guns in all price ranges. The third common material used is carbon fiber. The main advantages of carbon fiber is it’s rigid and light. The rigidity allows a more powerful and accurate shot. Because they are light, they are easy to travel with. Just like wooden guns, carbon fiber guns can be shaped into hydrodynamic shapes that help with maneuverability with larger guns.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;openclosed-mussel&quot;&gt;Open/Closed Mussel&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/open-closed-muzzle.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;The muzzle refers to the tip of the gun.  A closed muzzle has a small hole that the shaft must pass through.  This loosely secures the shaft and some people find it to be easier to load than the open muzzle.  The open muzzle lacks this hole at the tip of the gun, so you must secure the shaft to the gun using the overshaft wrapping technique.  This secures the shaft tightly to the gun with the shooting line and provides better accuracy.  I actually find reloading with an open muzzle much faster, so I recommend going with this style.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;bands&quot;&gt;Bands&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/bands.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are a few key aspects to speargun bands. The number of bands used, the length and the thickness. Specific band materials also play a role, but that is more about personal preference than anything else. Most spearguns use between one and three bands. Number of bands and their thickness will determine the power of your particular gun. For small to medium fish you will be using one or two bands. You can use one thicker band or two thinner bands to achieve the same power. The benefits of a single band is the simplicity and speed of reloading. Using two bands required less strength to reload each individual band and allows you to vary the power output. If you have a close shot with a rock behind the fish, you may only want to use one of the two bands to prevent the shaft from bending from the impact against the rock. The same goes for two versus three bands. The only difference being an increase in potential power.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;other-types-of-spearguns&quot;&gt;Other Types of Spearguns&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;pole-spear&quot;&gt;Pole Spear&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/Spearfishing-Traveler-Pole-Spear-1.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;These are a great, cheap alternative to a speargun. They do not work for every kind of hunting, but they are a perfect option for some people. They are used for close range targets and can even take out some medium sized fish. They can be a bit harder to use, but the ability to quickly reload and take multiple shots with a single breath can be a huge advantage!&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;pneumatic&quot;&gt;Pneumatic&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/pneumatic-cressi.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;These spearguns used compressed air, instead of bands, to propel the spear. The elimination of the bands results in a compact, sleek design. The downside to these guns is the need to pump up the chamber between each shot. They are perfect for shallow water diving, but loose power the deeper you go, due to the air compressing within the chamber.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;roller-guns&quot;&gt;Roller Guns&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;These are band powered spearguns, but are attached in a different way. They are typically all blue water guns. The advantage with these is the ability to pack more power into a shorter gun. The roller eliminates slack band length on top of the gun and allows the band to be stretched further within a smaller package.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;These are definitely not all of the aspects of a speargun, but with this information you should be able to narrow down your search to a couple great options that are perfectly suited for you. There is nothing worse than getting your first gun and realising that it is not at all suited for what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;construction&quot;&gt;Construction&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;While researching the perfect suit to buy, you are going to run into a few new terms; open cell, closed cell, single lined, double lined and naked neoprene. There are a few different ways to construct a freedive/spearfishing specific wetsuit and each has their own strengths and weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;double-lined&quot;&gt;Double-lined&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also referred to as “closed cell”. This suit has a lycra or nylon lining on both the inside and outside of the suit. This is how surf and scuba suits are constructed. This makes the suit much more durable and easy to get on. Unfortunately the lining on the outside restricts flexibility and decreases hydrodynamics. The lining on the inside makes it less warm.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;product-rating-wrapper&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/best-hunter-bifo-double-lined-5-mm-spearfishing-wetsuit.jpg&quot; /&gt;

    &lt;ul class=&quot;gear-ratings&quot;&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warmth:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Durability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;  1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydrodynamic:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;single-lined-outside&quot;&gt;Single-Lined (outside)&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is by far the most common freedive suit and the only type of suit used in spearfishing. The outer lining increases durability and prevents tears while bumping into rocks and other objects under water. Not only this, but it protects the neoprene from the harmful sun rays. It is the perfect combination of durability, flexibility and warmth. Because the inside is unlined, or open cell, it keeps you very warm. Untreated neoprene is like foam and has tons of little pores. These pores act like mini suction cups and cling to your skin, preventing any water from entering the suit. This “naked neoprene” on the inside of the suit is very fragile! Not only do you need lubricant to get into the suit, but even your fingernails can gouge holes in it. Be careful and this should not be a big problem.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIP:&lt;/strong&gt;Open cell typically refers to an untreated inside of the suit.&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;product-rating-wrapper&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/smooth-freediving-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;

  &lt;ul class=&quot;gear-ratings&quot;&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warmth:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Durability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flexibility:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;  3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hydrodynamic:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt; 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;single-lined-inside&quot;&gt;Single-Lined (inside)&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While this is also classified as a closed cell suit, it is completely different than a double lined suit and is usually referred to as “smooth skin”. This is basically the opposite of the other single lined wetsuit, The lycra lining is on the inside and the naked neoprene is on the outside. One difference is that the neoprene on the outside is coated with a material that fills in all the pores to make it more hydrodynamic. The lack of lining on the outside makes these suits ill fit for most kinds of diving. These are freedive specific and are only really worn by those who compete. The exposed neoprene degrades in UV light, so they will not last as long and require lots of care. Although the inner lining decreases the thermal capabilities, it makes the suit much easier to get on and off. No need for a lubricant.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;full-lycra&quot;&gt;Full Lycra&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This type of suit is the thinnest of the suits. It is made without neoprene and are more like a full-body rash guard. Tropical divers use these to add protection from the sun and the reef. These are a stretchy one piece suit without a zipper.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1-2mm&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;78 and up&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;25 and up&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3mm&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;65-77&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;18-25&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;5mm&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;50-65&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;10-18&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;7mm&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;55 and below&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;10 and below&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIP:&lt;/strong&gt;If you are at all confused, go to your local dive shop and ask what thickness suit people are wearing in your area. &lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h3 id=&quot;cold-water&quot;&gt;Cold Water&lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Usually 5-7mm&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Get the thinnest suit you can handle to maximize comfort. The thicker the suit, the more your breathing will be restricted. A thin suit also adds buoyancy and requires you to add more weight while diving. This makes it harder on your initial descent. There are two options for wetsuit bottoms; “High-waisted” and “Farmer John’s”. High waisted will allow the most flexibility and comfort, but if you still need more warmth and do not want to go to the next thickness, farmer john bottoms are a great option. These bottoms have straps that go over the shoulders. This doubles the amount of suit that covers your core and does a great job at keeping you warm. They do, however, compress your diaphragm and make it more difficult to inhale.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TIP:&lt;/strong&gt;Wetsuits compress over time. 3mm suit will only stay that thick for so long&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;color&quot;&gt;Color&lt;/h2&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;These are definitely not all of the aspects of a speargun, but with this information you should be able to narrow down your search to a couple great options that are perfectly suited for you. There is nothing worse than getting your first gun and realising that it is not at all suited for what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- /.medium-4.columns --&gt;



&lt;div class=&quot;medium-8 medium-pull-4 columns&quot;&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;mask--snorkel-20&quot;&gt;Mask / Snorkel ($20)&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/omer-alien-mask.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the mask first. It is far more important to find the correct mask compared to the snorkel because there is no one-size fits all option. Everyone has unique facial geometry, making it essential to actually go in and try on multiple different masks. Since this is a beginners guide, we will just be looking at the fit. Okay, so you might be wondering how one goes about ensuring a perfect fit? Well the two factors we are testing are the &lt;strong&gt;seal&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;comfort&lt;/strong&gt; of the mask.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO TIP:&lt;/strong&gt;You should shave any facial hair that will be in between the mask and your skin.&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;First thing to do when fitting is to remove the straps of the mask. You can get any mask to seal to your face if you cinch the straps tight enough, but the headache that will ensue is NOT worth it. Place the front of the mask to your face and gently press it on while inhaling through your nose to create a light suction. Tilt your head around and contort your face. A proper fitting mask will stay on for this test.
Next thing to look out for is the comfort. If any part of the mask seems to be hitting you in a weird place or digging in, keep looking. The chaffing that can result from this is no fun at all. One thing to note is that the more flexible the silicon skirt is, the better the seal you are going to get.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Some new masks will chafe the face for the first few dives. This will not be immediately evident while trying on masks in the store. This is due to the edges of the silicon and they will wear down. Scrubbing the edges with a coarse sponge can expedite this process.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Since we are trying to get spearing on a budget, there is no need to get a freedive specific mask. Any mask that seals properly and is comfortable for you is great for now. An added bonus of getting a cheap mask is that they almost always come with a snorkel. We won’t be too picky when it comes to snorkels since they are not very expensive. If given a choice, go with the most simple [J-Style] snorkel. This is simply because the snorkels that come with an inexpensive mask are cheaply made and the added bits will just break. Let’s save ourselves the headache and go with the simple one.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;These cheap masks are going to be what we call high-volume masks. This simply means that there is a larger volume of air between your face and the mask. Freediving specific masks are referred to as low-volume masks, and are much more expensive. The reason spearos prefer the low-volume masks is due to the fact that as you dive deeper, the mask compresses. Without equalizing the mask, you run the risk of getting “mask squeeze”.  This can result in broken blood vessels and a set of nice black eyes. Imagine a massive hickey across your face.  Not pretty! To equalize, you must exhale some air through your nose into the mask to combat the external pressure as you go deeper. Low-volume masks require less of your precious oxygen to equalize the mask. Thankfully this only really comes into play at depths below 30 or 40 feet.  For shallow diving there will be little to no benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;font-size-h3&quot;&gt;Where to Buy&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I recommend going to a sporting goods store over a dive shop for this because they will have much cheaper options. Remember, if you find multiple masks that fit, go for the cheapest one. Walmart and Target are also great places to check.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;font-size-h3&quot;&gt; Pretreating a New Mask&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Okay, so you finally bought your mask and you are ready to get into the water to try it out. There is one last step that even hardened vets forget to do before going out. You must clean the lenses before the first use, otherwise it is going to fog up so bad that you won’t be able to see anything. Dive session ruined! The lenses come out of the box with silicone residue/film that we must remove prior to the first use. There are a few remedies out there, but the easiest method is using toothpaste. The grit is enough to scrub the silicon, but not enough to scratch the lenses. This might take a few times to get it completely clean. Now your mask is ready.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;weights--belt-30&quot;&gt;Weights + Belt ($30)&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/weights_for_diving-600x450.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Weights are a necessary part of spearfishing. They allow you to reach the bottom with ease. The amount of weights you will use is dependent on how deep you plan on going and how buoyant you are with you suit on. Starting out, the key is to weight your belt so you become neutrally buoyant at about 15 feet down. This allows you to float at the surface, but still be able to sink to the bottom after a few kicks. For spearfishing, a rubber belt with a quick release clasp is ideal. As you descend on your dive, the pressure will compress you, making the belt become loose. Because a rubber belt stretches, you can cinch it tighter, and as you compress it stays tight to your waist. The quick release is a safety precaution. If you are in trouble the first thing you do is take your weights off. In a time of panic, having to deal with a clasp is not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO TIP:&lt;/strong&gt;You can use &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.divebuddy.com/calculator/weight.aspx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this calculator&lt;/a&gt; to determine the amount of weight you will need.&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;font-size-h3&quot;&gt;Where to Buy&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Any sort of lead block weight will do. Before purchasing this new, check out used weights. If you are lucky you can find them for free on Craigslist or super cheap at a flea market. Lead is surprisingly expensive at the store.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;fins-50&quot;&gt;Fins ($50)&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/mako-freediving-fins-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Here we have one of the key pieces of your setup. Fins are a necessity and there are so many different options, it can be overwhelming. To start out I will describe a few different types of fins. First we compare open-heal and full-foot fins. Open-heal fins are used by scuba divers and allows them to fit their large dive boots into the fin. Once your foot is secured, the strap secures the fin to your foot . Next there is full-foot fins. These are the kind you want. Having the foot pocket be one piece allows for maximum transfer of energy into the fin blade. Their low profile also creates less drag. In spearfishing you want your movements to be as efficient as possible to conserve your air. Now that we have narrowed our choices down a bit, we can talk about what options are best for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Swim fins are going to be the cheaper option but they are not designed for what you will be using them for. They are much shorter than a freediving fins, forcing you to take more kicks to reach the bottom. This will deplete your oxygen reserves substantially.
When I was going through the grueling task of acquiring my spearfishing starter pack, I came across an ongoing debate as to which fins are best to buy as a newbie. Some people say just go with the cheaper option since, as a beginner, there is no guarantee that you will end up pursuing this sport into the future. It would be a waste of money to get the high end if you don’t even know if you will even end up liking the sport. The other side argues that when it comes to fins, the price jump to freediving fins is well worth it. In Addition, your fins are likely to be the first thing you upgrade as you progress in the sport. Swim fins will do for your first few dives if you are strapped for cash and need to borrow some but I do not recommend investing any money into non-freediving fins.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Let’s talk about freediving fins. These are going to look huge compared to any other type of fins. They too are going to be full-footed. The length allows you to get to the bottom with a fraction of the effort. Material of the blades come into play here as well. The stiffer and springier the blade, the more energy will be transferred into the blades. You are going to want to go with a polymer blade. Although they are less efficient than fiberglass or carbon fiber fins, they are a hell of a lot more durable. I have seen so many people splurge on some nice fiberglass fins only to find themselves with a useless snapped fin ten minutes into the hunt. These fins are going to cost you around $70 for an intro grade pair and should last you a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;font-size-h3&quot;&gt;Where to Buy&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are many websites to purchase freediving fins from. Here are a few that have a wide selection:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leisurepro.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;leisurepro.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freedivershop.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;freedivershop.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Your local dive shop will be your best friend. It may be more expensive but, if you can afford it, it is well worth going there. They typically have great return policies and a variety of sizes to try on. It also supports your local diving community.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;dive-knife-10&quot;&gt;Dive Knife ($10)&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/k6_knife-sm.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is a necessity for both safety and killing your fish. You want to make sure the knife you get is sufficient. A folding knife will not do. You want to get a fixed blade knife with a sheath that you can strap to your body. Because the blade is going to have to puncture the skull of the fist, a nice narrow point is ideal. Serration is also a nice feature to look for. While you are puncturing the brain of the fish, realized that your hand is just on the other side of the fish. A long knife may go clean through into your hand. You should view your dive knife as semi-disposable since they are lost so often.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO TIP:&lt;/strong&gt; It is often useful to have an extra knife. You may lose one in the middle of a hunt, or not be able to reach one with your available hand.  They are cheap, so there is no harm in being over prepared.
&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;font-size-h3&quot;&gt;Where to Buy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are plenty of dive knives online for around $10. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is probably the easiest.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;stringer-20&quot;&gt;Stringer ($20)&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/stringer-SSLFS-2.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This simple device is often overlooked. It’s only once you forget it that you realize how important it is. The stringer. You have to have some place to put your kill. There are a few different styles of stringer, but any type will do at this point, just make sure it is secure. You don’t want to have any of your catch to go missing. The stringer is going to either be attached to your weight belt, or some sort of flotation device. Just know that if you plan on hanging it off your belt, it can hinder your mobility or get caught in the kelp.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;font-size-h3&quot;&gt;Where to Buy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You can get a cheap stringer at any fishing supply store, order one online or simply make your own. I have seen one made from a coat hanger. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is always a cheap option.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;wetsuit-200&quot;&gt;Wetsuit ($200)&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/salvimar-nat-suit.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Being cold sucks. Wearing proper gear for your environment is key. A suit is more often than not a must when it comes to spearfishing. A suit is also where you are going to be spending a large portion of your budget. For your first few dives I would recommend using any wetsuit you can get your hands on. If you are diving in colder waters, getting a hooded vest to go over the top is a must. If you decide you like the sport, you are going to want to buy a spearfishing specific wetsuit. For your first proper wetsuit you are going to be spending some money, but the lack of zippers, built in hood and open-cell neoprene is going to make it infinitely more comfortable and warm. Watch out though, they are much more delicate and require a certain level of care to maintain them. Two great companies that offer budget spearfishing wetsuits are Mako Spearguns and Salvimar. The prices depend on how thick of a suit you need, but it is going to cost you around $200-$350. Once you know what thickness you need, the next step is to find out what size you are. Sizing charts online are typically pretty accurate, but you are going to want to measure yourself. The sizes for different brands are often different.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;gloves-10&quot;&gt;Gloves ($10)&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/dive-gloves-walmart.jpeg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This may seem of minimal importance, especially if you are going to be diving in warmer waters but gloves are crucial. They provide much needed protection from the environment and warmth for those colder waters . You would be surprised how many sharp things are down there. Ironically, most spearfishing gloves provide less protection than you might require. This is good for us though. Remember we are thrifty people and spearfishing specific equipment is typically exceedingly pricey.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;font-size-h3&quot;&gt;Where to Buy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you don’t have a problem with cold hands, go to your local hardware store and buy a pair of Nitrile or Latex coated work gloves. These gloves are going to offer way more
protection and I picked up my current pair for less than $5. They also last a lot longer than the fancy neoprene gloves I previously used.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;socks-15&quot;&gt;Socks ($15)&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/dive-socks.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Socks serve two functions; warmth and comfort. They prevent your foot from chaffing and help get a nice snug fit in your fins. When shore diving, they make your walk to the water so much more enjoyable, especially when it’s a rocky environment. If you are shore diving, these socks are going to be semi-disposable since the pavement and rocks really tear at the neoprene. Due to this, the cheapest option is going to be the best option.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;font-size-h3&quot;&gt;Where to Buy&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;As you might have guessed, I have a hot tip to save money on this piece of your setup. Aliexpress! Have you heard of it? It is a Chinese Amazon type marketplace, but with vastly reduced prices… and quality. Since we are only talking about socks here, there isn’t going to be a huge difference between the $30 brand name socks and the cheap Chinese knockoffs.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; They often have misleading pictures and descriptions of their products. It is not a good idea to buy anything expensive from this site. You WILL have a bad day when your shipment arrives. &amp;lt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;mark&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO TIP:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure you are buying dive socks not dive boots. Dive boots have a thick sole like a shoe and you will not be able to fit them into the type of fins you will be wearing.
&lt;/mark&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;weapon-150&quot;&gt;Weapon ($150)&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/speargun.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Lastly, we need something to hunt with. There are some different options for this. There are two general categories: the pole spear and the speargun. A pole spear is far less expensive than a speargun gun, so lots of beginners start there and then move up to a gun. The problem with this idea is that a pole is much harder to hunt with. A beginning spearo has so much more to deal with than
simply getting a proper shot off. I think it is a good idea to start with a speargun since it will get you familiar with the sport faster. When buying a speargun, what you need to know first is the types of fish and kind of environment you are going to be diving in. Because you won’t be able to go very deep at first, there is no need for a long gun. Short guns are much easier to wield underwater and allow you to place more focus on the hunt. Ask your local dive shop or look in forums to see what size and type of guns people are using in your area. There are a lot of different styles of guns with a lot of conflicting opinions about each type.  To make this easy on you, I will briefly describe the different types of guns out there.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Band Powered:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a speargun that propels the spear using a rubber band, similar to a slingshot on a stick.  These are the most common style of gun and are easy to maintain and repair.  Either one or two bands are normally used, depending on how much power you desire.  Two lighter bands are useful if you want the power, but do not have the strength to load a single powerful band.  A single band is more desirable for beginners because it is simple and less likely to get tangled up.  Most band powered guns come with the option of either open or closed muzzle.  The muzzle refers to the tip of the gun.  A closed muzzle has a small hole that the shaft must pass through.  This loosely secures the shaft and some people find it to be easier to load than the open muzzle.  The open muzzle lacks this hole at the tip of the gun, so you must secure the shaft to the gun using the overshaft wrapping technique.  This secures the shaft tightly to the gun with the shooting line and provides better accuracy.  I actually find reloading with an open muzzle much faster, so I recommend going with this style.  There are a lot of different terms people throw around describing different types of guns such as railgun, pipe gun, Euro gun, American style, ect.  For now, this is not so important.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;For a cheap reliable gun, it is hard to beat the Mako Predator. It is simple and stands the test of time. I recommend getting the single banded option because it is just less to deal with. Regardless of what gun you pick, an open-mussel is going to make your life a lot easier while reloading.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Want to learn more about buying a speargun? &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/buyers-guide/buying-a-speargun/&quot;&gt;Read our speargun buyers guide.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p class=&quot;font-size-h3&quot;&gt;Where to Buy&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are many websites to buy spearguns from. Here are a few that have a wide selection:&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.makospearguns.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;makospearguns.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.leisurepro.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;leisurepro.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.freedivershop.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;freedivershop.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;amazon.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;float--flag-30&quot;&gt;Float / Flag ($30)&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;product&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/img/float-flags-l400.jpg&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Some sort of flotation device is not necessary, but can prove useful. They are great for holding your stringer, a water bottle, and a dive flag. Lots of people simply make one out of an old boogie board. Having a float out with you is nice if your leg cramps up, or if a strong current arises. You should be able to buy a float and flag from any local dive shop, or the websites mentioned above in other sections.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Make sure to check local regulations. Some regions require a dive flag while you are in the water.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;h2 id=&quot;take-care-of-your-gear&quot;&gt;Take Care of Your Gear&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Once you have all your gear you are going to need to learn how to care for it all. If neglected, the equipment will deteriorate very quickly! The combination of saltwater and sun is a killer. When maintained properly, this stuff should last you a good while. Upgrading your equipment is inevitable and will be a process of its own.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Two brothers that discovered how fun underwater hunting can be</title>
				<link>http://localhost:4000/about</link>
				<pubDate>Sat, 20 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;We are Calvin &amp;amp; Oscar Hawkes from &lt;a href=&quot;https://goo.gl/maps/Hh4mug5jk4S2&quot;&gt;Monterey, CA&lt;/a&gt;. Oscar is 3 years younger, but 5 inches taller, so Calvin thinks it’s a wash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2016, Oscar bought his first speargun and the rest is history. Turns out, fishing is much more fun when you are trying to shoot the fish with a sort of modified crossbow. We were no longer stuck on the surface with a pole in our hands, hoping a fish would bite the hook. We could actively hunt fish, holding our breath and tracking them down through any hole or crevice we could find.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we started to get deeper and more involved in the sport, we realized there was a serious lack of information about the sport online. It seems everytime I had a question, the only results were a 5-year old forum post or some sketchy looking website from the ’90s. So we created SpearHunters. A modern, up-to-date guide to spearfishing. We wrote these guides in hopes that other speros will find the information as useful as we did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Spearfishing Gear - Starter Pack for Beginners</title>
				<link>http://localhost:4000/spearfishing-gear-starter-pack-for-beginners/</link>
				<pubDate>Sun, 11 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;When I first got interested in spearfishing and decided to finally buy some gear I was immediately overwhelmed by the information being thrown at me. Where do I even start? To make things even more difficult, most beginners guides did not include some of the gear I was going to need for the cold water. I wanted to make an in depth guide to help those of you who are just starting out and to get you spearing as soon as possible. Buying a whole set of gear is a daunting task, but when you know what to look for, it can be painless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;masksnorkel-20&quot;&gt;Mask/Snorkel: [$20]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the mask first. It is far more important to find the correct mask compared to the snorkel because there is no one-size fits all option. Everyone has unique facial geometry making it essential to actually go in and try on multiple different masks. Since this is a beginners guide, we will just be looking at the fit. Okay, so you might be wondering how one goes about insuring a perfect fit. Well the two factors we are testing are the seal and comfort of the mask.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;box-note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro tip:&lt;/strong&gt; You should shave any facial hair that would be in between the mask and your skin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First thing to do when fitting is to remove the straps of the mask. You can get any mask to seal to your face if you cinch the straps tight enough, but the headache that will ensue is NOT worth it. Place the front of the mask to your face and gently press it on while inhaling through your nose to create a light suction. Tilt your head around and contort your face. A proper fitting mask will stay on for this test.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next thing to look out for is the comfort. If any part of the mask seems to be hitting you in a weird place or digging in, keep looking. The chaffing that can result from this is no fun at all. One thing to note is that the more flexible the silicon skirt is, the better seal you are going to get.
Since we are trying to get spearing on a budget, there is no need to get a free dive specific mask. Any mask that seals properly and is comfortable for you is great for now. An added bonus of getting a cheap mask is that they almost always come with a snorkel. We won’t be too picky when it comes to snorkels since they are not very expensive. If given a choice, go with the most simple [J-Style] snorkel. This is simply because the snorkels that come with the mask you will be buying are cheaply made and the added bits will just break. Let’s save ourselves the headache and go with the simple one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These cheap masks are going to be what we call high-volume masks. This simply means that there is a larger volume of air between your face and the mask. Freediving specific masks are referred to as low-volume masks, and are much more expensive. The reason spearos prefer the low-volume masks is due to the fact that as you dive deeper, the mask compresses. Without equalizing the mask, you run the risk of getting “mask squeeze”.  This can result in broken blood vessels and a couple nice black eyes. Imagine a massive hickey across your face.  Not pretty! To equalize, you must exhale some air through your nose into the mask to combat the external pressure as you go deeper. Low-volume masks require less of your precious oxygen to equalize the mask. Thankfully this only really comes into play at depths below 30 or 40 feet.  For shallow diving there will be little to no benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;where-to-buy-a-freedivingsnorkelling-mask&quot;&gt;Where to Buy a Freediving/Snorkelling Mask:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recommend going to a sporting goods store over a dive shop for this because they will have much cheaper options. Remember, if you find multiple masks that fit, go for the cheapest one. Walmart and Target are also great places to check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;box-warning&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before you use your mask:&lt;/strong&gt; The lenses come out of the box with silicone residue/film that we must remove prior to the first use.If you don’t,  the lenses will fog up so bad that you won’t be able to see anything. There are a few ways out there, but the easiest method is using toothpaste. The grit is enough to scrub the silicon, but not enough to scratch the lenses. This might take a few times to get it completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;weights--belt-20&quot;&gt;Weights + Belt: [$20]&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weights are a necessary part of spearfishing. They allow you to reach the bottom with ease. The amount of weights you will use is dependent on how deep you plan on going and how buoyant you are with you suit on. The key is to weight your belt so you become neutrally buoyant at about 15 feet down. This allows you to float at the surface, but still be able to sink to the bottom after a few kicks. For spearfishing, a rubber belt with a quick release clasp is ideal. As you descend on your dive, the pressure will compress you, making the belt become loose. Because a rubber belt stretches, you can cinch it tighter, and as you compress it stays tight to your waist. The quick release is a safety precaution. If you are in trouble the first thing you do is take your weights off. In a time of panic, having to deal with a clasp is not a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;box-note&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Here is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://saltnomads.com/freediving-weight/&quot;&gt;great guide&lt;/a&gt; to help you calculate the amount of weight you will be needing.&lt;/p&gt;
